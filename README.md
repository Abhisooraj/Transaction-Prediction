Understanding the consumption pattern for credit cards at an individual consumer level is important for customer relationship management. This understanding allows banks to customize for consumers and make strategic marketing plans. Thus it is imperative to study the relationship between the characteristics of the consumers and their consumption patterns.   XYZ Bank has given a sample of their customers, along with their details like age, gender and other demographics. Also shared are information on liabilities, assets and history of transactions with the bank for each customer.   In addition to the above, data has been provided for a particular set of customers' credit card spend in the previous 3 months (April, May &amp; June) and their expected average spend in the coming 3 months (July, August &amp; September). Predict the average spend for a different set of customers in the test set for the coming 3 months.
